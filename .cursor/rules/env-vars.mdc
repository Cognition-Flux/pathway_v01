## Environment Variables Management

1. **Storage Location**
   - All environment variables (such as API keys, endpoints, or configuration settings) must be stored in the `.env` file at the project root
   - Never commit the `.env` file to version control - ensure it's included in `.gitignore`
   - Provide a `.env.example` file with placeholder values to document required variables

2. **Usage Guidelines**
   - Use descriptive names in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE format
   - Group related variables with comments
   - Include type hints in variable names when appropriate (e.g., `API_KEY`, `URL`, `ENABLED`)
   - Document the purpose and format of each variable in the `.env.example` file

3. **Access Pattern**
   - Use the `os.getenv()` function with a default value as a fallback
   - Validate environment variables at application startup
   - Consider using a dedicated environment variable management library for complex configurations

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Never log environment variable values
   - Treat all environment variables as sensitive information
   - Implement proper error handling for missing required variables
