"""Agentic graph playground package.

This package gathers experimental agents, tools and prompts used while
building the *TPP agentic graph* prototype.  The goal is to be able to
import any function or class that lives anywhere under this directory by
simply doing::

    from dev.tpp_agentic_graph_v4 import MyFunction, MyClass

All sub-packages are automatically discovered on import so that their
public symbols are re-exported from this package's namespace.  Public
symbols are defined by the ``__all__`` variable of every sub-module.  If
``__all__`` is not present, **all** top-level names that do not start
with an underscore ("_*") are considered public.

The traversal happens only once, at import time, and is lightweight
because it relies on ``pkgutil.walk_packages`` which inspects the
filesystem without executing the byte-code of each module.  Actual
modules are imported lazily on first access via ``importlib.import_module``.
